/**
 * The numbers that decide how a SET 2..7 gun *feels*, taken from slide 7 itself.
 *
 * Slide 1 owns the flight, the hit test and the score, so a slide-7 round is
 * flown by slide 1's carrier. That carrier used to fly at slide 1's own `speed`
 * and reload on slide 1's own `cooldown`, which is why every imported gun felt
 * off: the snowball flew 2000 px/s instead of 1050, the bee fired every 0.10 s
 * instead of 0.50 s, the bazooka reached the wheel in half the time…
 *
 * Slide 7 keeps both numbers where it always has: the trigger interval in
 * `weapons.ts` (`WeaponDef.cooldown`) and the launch speed in each projectile
 * class's `super(g, x, y, SPEED)` call, which the base class stores as `vy`.
