/**
 * Silence for the arsenal's *card* previews.
 *
 * The design/effect picker paints the real shot of every layer — slide 1's own
 * rounds, slide 7's, 9's, 11's and slide 2's — by running that layer's own
 * `fire()` recipe on a throwaway object, 18 times a second. Those recipes also
 * play their layer's voice, so opening the card of a charged gun (EMERALD,
 * RAILGUN, MOONBEAM, BUSTER…) used to repeat its charge-up whine over and over
 * while you were choosing: the "spam" sound on the picker.
 *
 * `silentPreview()` mutes every ported layer for the length of one paint, then
 * puts each layer's own mute state back — slide 1's mute button and slide 11's
 * stored preference stay untouched.
