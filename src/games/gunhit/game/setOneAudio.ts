/**
 * Exact slide-7 (Weapon Hit 71 Senjata / `games/game-4`) audio for slide 1.
 *
 * Slide 7 synthesises every sound procedurally in its own `SFX` class
 * (`games/game-4/src/game/audio.ts`). Instead of re-typing those envelopes we
 * play the real class, so SET 1 sounds identical to slide 7 — same graph,
 * same compressor (-14 / 6), same master gain, same stacked noise+tone
 * recipes, note for note: golden_fire/golden_hit, bh_charge/bh_fire/bh_hit,
 * sling_fire/sling_hit, sumpit_fire/sumpit_hit, shotgun_fire/pump/shotgun_hit
 * and soaker_fire/splash.
