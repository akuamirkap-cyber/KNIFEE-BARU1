/**
 * Slide-6 (`games/game-2` / Weapon Wheel Hit) artwork for slide 1.
 *
 * Slide 6 is the older `Weapon Wheel Hit`: sixteen guns, one rotating wheel,
 * and the same three beam weapons slide 9 later redrew (`Sniper Beam`,
 * `Tripod Heat-Ray`, `Iron Man Repulsor`). Those three already exist on slide 1
 * through the slide-9 export (`railgun`, `heat_ray`, `gauntlet_cannon`), so
 * slide 6 does not add a gun: it adds another *design* (and another *shot*) to
 * the guns that already carry that name.
 *
 * Nothing is redrawn here. Slide 6's real `drawWeapon()` renders the gun, at
 * slide 1's muzzle origin, with slide 6's own `WState` (draw progress + time
 * since the trigger), so the barrel, its glow and its pulse are byte-identical
 * to slide 6's own frame.
